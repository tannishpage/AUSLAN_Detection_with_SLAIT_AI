# Introduction
This repository is part of my Summer Research Project. The goal of the project is to explore the possibility to detect Auslan using the Zipf-Mandelbrot-Li Fast Entropy Function which is a component of SLAIT AI (A method devised by Dr Andrew Back). The first step to calculating the entropy of a signer is to symbolize their hand movement using the [Video Symbolizer](https://github.com/tannishpage/video_symbolizer). This repository contains code to calculate and plot the entropy of the symbolized data.

# Usage

All the scripts have detailed command line help outputs to asist the user. To access the help output just run the script with no arguments or pass the `--help` argument.
